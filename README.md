# Jussi Front-End Teste

You can see the test [here](https://github.com/jussilabs/jussi-frontend-test)!

## What's on this project:

* HTML

* CSS

* Vanilla JavaScript


## I've been using this patterns to make a clean code structure:

* I used my [boilerplate](https://github.com/gabriel-brito/bebop-boilerplate) to make this project.

* An adaptation of BEM (Block, Element, Modifier)

* Stylus Pre-Processor 

* Gulp with Babel

* Babel (to add ECMAScript6 support to older browsers :D)

* A simple TDD with Chai and Mocha


## how it works? 

It's simple! Follow the instructions bellow:

First of all, you need to clone this repo with:

```
https://github.com/gabriel-brito/black-friday
``` 
You need to have gulp and gulp-cli on your machine, so:

```
npm install gulp gulp-cli -g

```

And then you install a local server and the dependencies inside the project with:

```
cd black-friday

npm i

```

Then you just need to run:

```
gulp
```

Now you can access by your browser with your own location!

Ex: localhost:8080

Simple, not?

## Notes:

Good news:

* I didn't used any framework or JavaScript library :) 

* The javascript is modularized, so the understanding of the code is very easy.

* I separated all the css in modules and components, to find some code is really easy.

* I minified all the images, css, javascript etc.

* The loading of the page is really fast.

* Everything is responsive.

* It's my first time making an cart from zero. That was awesome! I learned a lot!

Bad news:

* All the items from Data has the same ID, so the cart just add one Item.

* I didn't have time to make quantity and total features.

* I use Ubuntu in my machine, so I don't have an photoshop. I couldn't pick the background from hero section. Everything was made on eye.
